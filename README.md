## Overview  
The Unified Bharat Framework is a structured analysis of India’s policy landscape from 2014 to 2025. It consolidates major reforms, program outcomes, institutional transitions, and long-term governance trends across seven domains.  
The goal is to offer a single, coherent reference that documents how various initiatives connect to broader national transformation.

This repository includes:

- 150+ policy initiatives  
- Year-by-year verified timelines  
- Data-backed performance indicators  
- Thematic insights across law, economy, culture, infrastructure, and governance  
- CSV trackers, source documents, and analysis notes

## Purpose  
India has seen wide-ranging policy changes between 2014 and 2025. While each initiative can be studied on its own, their broader impact becomes clearer when viewed as part of a connected structure.

This framework organizes that structure using five pillars:

1. **Legal Modernization**  
2. **Demographic and Social Governance**  
3. **Institutional Integration**  
4. **Cultural and Civilizational Projects**  
5. **Infrastructure and Economic Modernization**

## The Five Pillars

### **1. Legal Modernization & Uniformity**  
Reforms that reshape India’s legal architecture, including new criminal laws, changes related to Article 370, and developments affecting civil and personal law.  
Focus: clearer national standards and replacement of colonial-era structures.

### **2. Demographic & Social Governance**  
Policies connected to marriage registration, conversion regulations, population-focused discussions, and family documentation.  
Focus: administrative clarity and long-term demographic planning.

### **3. Institutional Integration**  
Systems that unify governance across states and sectors.  
Examples include GST, JAM Trinity, Ayushman Bharat, One Nation One Ration Card, and NEP 2020.

### **4. Cultural & Symbolic Initiatives**  
Nation-scale heritage and identity projects.  
Examples: Ram Mandir, Kashi Vishwanath Corridor, Statue of Unity, National War Memorial, the new Parliament building.

### **5. Infrastructure & Economic Modernization**  
National upgrades in transport, logistics, and digital infrastructure.  
Examples: Bharatmala, freight corridors, airports, metro expansions, expressways, renewable energy, and smart city development.
